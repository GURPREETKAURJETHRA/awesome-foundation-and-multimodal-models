**foundation model** - a pre-trained machine learning model that serves as a base for a wide range of downstream tasks. It captures general knowledge from a large dataset and can be fine-tuned to perform specific tasks more effectively.

**multimodal model** - a model that can process multiple modalities (e.g. text, image,
video, audio, etc.) at the same time.
